+ Projec title: Words 4 Music
+ Project summary: This project attempts to predict a song's lyrics using only the musical features of a song. 
+ Methodology: I focused on predicting songs in English language only, therefore the first step consisted in removing all non-English songs from the training data (see ./lib/discard_non_english.R). Then the musical features were extracted for each song and saved as a matrix of predictors (see ./lib/build_feature_matrix.R). Topic models with K=5, 10, 15 and 20 topics was fitted to the corpus of (English-language) songs using the R package 'topicmodels' (see ./lib/fit_topicmodel.R). Each topic model was inspected by verifying that the words the words indeed seemed to form coherent topics (see ./lib/plot_topic_model.R). Topic models with K=5 and K=20 were discarded this way. Then I trained a GBM classifier to predict the main topic of each song based on the song features. For this, I used the R package 'xgboosting' and the shrinkage, max depth, number of iterations and subsample parameters were tuned using 5-fold cross-validation (see ./lib/topic_classifier.R). Testing accuracy was better for topics generated by the model with K=15 topics (compared to K=10) and therefore only this topic model was used subsequently. Importantly, the output of the GBM classifier is not the single most probable topic but, rather, each topic is assigned a probability of being present in the song. Finally, the function ./lib/predict_words.R assigns a probabilty ranking to each word in a list by: (1) extracting the musical features of the song, (2) using the classifier identify probable topics based on these features and (3) ranking the words according to their likelihood given the most probable topics.
